# Manual rollback for "it deployed cleanly but we found a problem after the
# fact" - redeploys a previously-successful image through the EXACT same
# safe blue/green pipeline as deploy.sh, so rollback is itself zero-downtime
# and health-checked, never a raw `docker compose down`.
#
# (Automatic rollback for a build that fails its OWN health check happens
# inside deploy.sh directly and doesn't need this script at all.)
#
# Usage:
#   rollback.sh                # roll back to the last successful image
#                               # before the one currently live
#   rollback.sh <image_ref>    # roll back to a specific tag
